Thread states:

	Uninitialized
	Thread settings are not valid
	Transition to:
		Runnable

	Runnable
	Thread can be executed. It may or may not be running right now.
	Transition to:
		Waiting, Uninitialized

	Waiting
	Thread is waiting for a signal and not executing
	Transition to:
		Runnable



set signal:
	disable interrupts
	if signal flag is not set:
		if a thread is waiting on signal:
			no thread is waiting on signal
			transition thread from waiting to runnable (this might request scheduler interrupt)
		else:
			set signal flag
	enable interrupts

wait on signal & clear afterward:
	disable interrupts
	if signal flag is not set:
		mark that current thread is waiting on signal
		transition current thread from runnable to waiting (this requests scheduler interrupt)
		enable interrupts
		nop (this ensures that scheduler interrupt gets time to run - necessary?)
	else:
		clear signal
		enable interrupts
	

transition thread i from waiting to runnable:
	; interrupts are already disabled
	i.state = runnable
	if current thread > i:
		desired thread = i
		request scheduler interrupt

transition current thread (i) from runnable to waiting:
	; interrupts are already disabled
	i.state = waiting
	for j = i to num_threads:

			break

	request scheduler interrupt


set signal from interrupt:
	if signal flag is not set:
		if a thread is waiting on signal:
			no thread is waiting on signal
			transition thread from waiting to runnable (this requests scheduler interrupt)
